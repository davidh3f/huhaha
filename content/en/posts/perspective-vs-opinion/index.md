When in an disagreement, do you provide a perspective or an opinion?

*Perspective*

a particular attitude toward or way of regarding something; a point of view.

*Opinion*

a view or judgment formed about something, not necessarily based on fact or knowledge.

*– Dictionary.com*

It’s hard to tell the difference from their definitions, isn’t it.

An opinion, especially a strong one, typically implies right from wrong, good from bad, and superiority from inferiority. In another word, there is often little room for ambiguity and options.

A perspective, in contrast, emphasizes on one point of view of many; therefore, accepts ambiguity and opens, maybe even respects to other options. In a way, it is a subset of opinions that attempts to influence based more on reason, less on power.

They both serve the purpose of “getting your point across”; but they work most effectively only when one possesses the skill of matching them to the right circumstances.
